=head1 NAME

Test::Pod::No404s - Using this test module will check your POD for any http 404 links

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v0.02 of Test::Pod::No404s - released November 01, 2014 as part of Test-Pod-No404s.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	use strict; use warnings;

	use Test::More;

	eval "use Test::Pod::No404s";
	if ( $@ ) {
		plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::No404s required for testing POD';
	} else {
		all_pod_files_ok();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module looks for any http(s) links in your POD and verifies that they will not return a 404. It uses L<LWP::UserAgent> for the heavy
lifting, and simply lets you know if it failed to retrieve the document. More specifically, it uses $response->is_error as the "test."

This module does B<NOT> check "pod" or "man" links like C<LE<lt>Test::PodE<gt>> in your pod. For that, please check out L<Test::Pod::LinkCheck>.

Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user installation because they might have no internet! It is HIGHLY recommended
that this be used only for module authors' RELEASE_TESTING phase. To do that, just modify the synopsis to add an env check :)

=head1 METHODS

=head2 pod_file_ok

C<pod_file_ok()> will okay the test if there is no http(s) links present in the POD or if all links are not an error. Furthermore, if the POD was
malformed as reported by L<Pod::Simple>, the test will fail and not attempt to check the links.

When it fails, C<pod_file_ok()> will show any failing links as diagnostics.

The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test.  If it is omitted, C<pod_file_ok()> chooses a default
test name "404 test for FILENAME".

=head2 all_pod_files_ok

This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any POD in your distribution and runs checks on them.

Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it checks all POD files it can find in the distribution. Every file it finds
is passed to the C<pod_file_ok> function.

=head1 EXPORT

Automatically exports the two subs.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

A file named F<.no404-ignore> in the current directory will be read as a list of URLs to ignore. Each URL must be on its own line. Leading and trailing whitespace on these URLs is ignored.

To temporary disable URLs from the F<.no404s-ignore> add e.g., a C<#> in front of the line. The C<#> does not have a special meaning but it changes the URL's protocol to be unknown and hence not checked.
