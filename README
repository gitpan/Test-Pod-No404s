NAME
    Test::Pod::No404s - Checks POD for http 404 links

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;

            use Test::More;

            eval "use Test::Pod::No404s";
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Pod::No404s required for testing POD';
            } else {
                    all_pod_files_ok();
            }

ABSTRACT
    Using this test module will check your POD for any http 404 links.

DESCRIPTION
    This module looks for any http(s) links in your POD and verifies that
    they will not return a 404. It uses LWP::UserAgent for the heavy
    lifting, and simply lets you know if it failed to retrieve the document.
    More specifically, it uses $response->is_error as the "test."

    Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user
    installation because they might have no internet! It is HIGHLY
    recommended that this be used only for module authors' RELEASE_TESTING
    phase. To do that, just modify the synopsis to add an env check :)

Methods
  all_pod_files_ok( [ @files ] )
    This function is what you will usually run. It automatically finds any
    POD in your distribution and runs checks on them.

    Accepts an optional argument: an array of files to check. By default it
    checks all POD files it can find in the distribution. Every file it
    finds is passed to the "pod_file_ok" function.

  pod_file_ok( FILENAME, [ TESTNAME ] )
    "pod_file_ok()" will okay the test if there is no http(s) links present
    in the POD or if all links are not an error. Furthermore, if the POD was
    malformed as reported by Pod::Simple, the test will fail and not attempt
    to check the links.

    When it fails, "pod_file_ok()" will show any failing links as
    diagnostics.

    The optional second argument TESTNAME is the name of the test. If it is
    omitted, "pod_file_ok()" chooses a default test name "404 test for
    FILENAME".

EXPORT
    Automatically exports the two subs.
